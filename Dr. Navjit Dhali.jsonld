    "motivations": "I’ve been through the trenches - raising funds, dealing with auditors, building teams and launching products. I know how hard it is to move from idea to mainnet. I also know the kind of governance support builders actually need.\n\nI’ve helped bring Cardano-native solutions through real due diligence and into enterprise conversations, not as an advisor but as someone responsible for delivery. I want to bring that lens to DRep voting: practical, accountable and grounded in outcomes.",
    "objectives": "As a DRep, I want to help governance shift from idealism to execution. That means supporting proposals that bring real utility to Cardano, dApps with users, tools that remove friction and infrastructure that unlocks broader adoption.\n\nI’ll vote based on clear KPIs, builder credibility and ecosystem impact. Not hype, not popularity and not vague roadmaps. I believe governance should reward those who show up and ship.\n\n\n",

    "qualifications": "- Raised public and private funding, including EU and Innovation Norway grants\n\n- Experience with DAO structures, treasury mechanics and compliance reviews\n\n- 10+ years in leadership roles across healthcare, tech and infrastructure\n\n- Active voice in Cardano community and a consistent advocate for quality \n\n",
